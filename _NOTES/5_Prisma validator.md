# Prisma validator

This is very important since I love using Prisma and it will serve me well in my projects

<https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/advanced-type-safety/prisma-validator>

In this project Prisma validator is used inside [ProjectCard Server Component](/components/ProjectCard.tsx)

**FOR ME PERSONALY I WANT TO USE IT AS A WAY TO EXTRACT TYPES, BUT NOT USE `Exclude` OR `Ommit` OR SIMILAR GENERICS DIRECTLY ON RESULT OF A QUERY** (BASICALLY I WANT TO GET TYPES AHEAD OF TYME)
